# local languages engine

This is the message that started it all
> Is there an existing project out there that allows an AI system to learn and speak shona?

## vocab
**indiginous languages** (please add more that are not listed here): 
- Shona 
- Ndebele 
- Ndau 
- Tonga
- Khalanga 
- *and their variants

## Motivation
A local language AI system will be positive for the country benefiting both young and old in a wide range of scenarios
Our local languages are [dying](http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_8311000/8311069.stm). Our government lacks the necessary resources to save them. As a community we are undertaking this project with the hope of using technology to preserve our languages and possibly create AI that speaks and can teach our languages.
Uses of such a system;
- think siri in shona
- language translation
- a system that can teach local languages
- system for filtering hate speech on social media platforms
- a great national service initiative 

## challenges
- local language variants. There is no unified Shona language for instance. Dialects have to be accounted for in particular if we are interested in language translation
- No linguistics subject matter experts (SMEs) within the data science community. We are going to need the help of people that understand our local languages deeply
- lack of credible local language corpus


english AIs already exist so just create a dictionary that will map every english word to a corresponding Shona one processing will be done in English just like how a person can think in Shona then speak in English 
PS this is a laymen's idea
